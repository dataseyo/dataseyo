### Zachary Shifrel

Hi, I'm a philosopher of physics turned software engineer. Here are some links:

[masters thesis](https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/handle/10919/102340) (sadly it seems to have received the lorem ipsum treatment recently)

Some Conferences: [PSA 1](https://psa2020.philsci.org/program-schedule/sponsor-lounge/program/54/concepts-as-epistemic-tools-a-comparative-approach) and [PSA 2](https://psa2018.philsci.org/component/dryfta/abstract/public/430/110-biological-structures)

Here's what I'm working on:

- 🔭 I’m currently refining my knowledge of React using the MERN stack and the MVC design pattern. By building a variety of applications equipped with all of the CRUD operations, I'm learning how to best engineer data-intensive projects while exploring unit/integration testing, mobile first design practices, libraries like React query, Material UI, React router, and React spring, and also other best practices like custom hooks for fetching data, code splitting for larger applications, and error handling.
- 📝 My main side projects now are Grade Guesser (a social media app for climbers where one guesses the difficulty of a boulder), an idle game, and a few websites with authorization and a mongodb/mongoose/express backend.
- 🔬 I’m currently studying ... statistical learning theory, automated scientific discovery, and the renormalization of effective quantum field theories.
