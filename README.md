**What I'm working on:**

- 🔭 refining my knowledge of React using the MERN stack and the MVC design pattern, along with Typescript for type checking, Jest for testing, and Redux Toolkit for state management. I'm also using python to both create test data and interface with databases like MongoDB.
- 📝 My main side projects are Homewall, an idle game, and an ETL pipeline to work with Kafka.
- 💻 I'm currently learning ... Kubernetes, Kafka, React Three Fiber (and its companion libraries), some of the Azure cloud computing architecture, and higher level design/component/services patterns in React and Node.js.
- 🔬 I’m currently studying ... statistical learning theory, automated scientific discovery, and the renormalization of effective quantum field theories.
