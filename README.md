### Zachary Shifrel

Hi, I'm a philosopher of physics turned software engineer. 

**Technologies I work with:**

- Languages: Python, HTML/CSS/JS, Typescript, GLSL
- Frameworks: React and React Native, Angular
- Databases: MongoDB, MySQL
- Tools: Git, Node js, Express, Mongoose, NPM
- Styling: CSS Modules, Bootstrap, Material UI
- Cloud: AWS, (a little) Azure
- Containers: Docker and Kubernetes for orchestration
- Event Streaming: Kafka
- 3D: three.js, React Three Fiber/Drei/Canon, Spline

**What I'm working on:**

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently excited about building interactive web and app experiences that are both computationally affordable and responsive, using React three fiber, three js, GLSL, and Blender. 
- ðŸ’» On the software side, I'm studying everything that has to do with the above, as well as the technologies I use at work and in my passion projects ranging from Kubernetes, Kafka, and Docker to Redux Toolkit, Django, Tensorflow, and so on. 
- ðŸ”¬ Outside of software, I'm still learning more about the renormalization of effective quantum field theories and how to use renormalization for fields besides physics, climate physics, statistical learning and automated scientific discovery, and even the finger tendon recovery and hypertrophy literature!
