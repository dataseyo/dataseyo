I'm a philosopher of physics turned software engineer with an interest in fields like scientific computing, astrodynamics, automated scientific discovery, the renormalization group, the foundations of quantum field theory, and high outdoor boulders! 

Currently working at Rocket Lab across the fields of GSW, FDS, and OPS on missions like Thunder, Scorpius, Escapade, Blue Ghost 2, etc. with some of the most talented human beings on the planet.
